  and fails to find the cocaine both times.(The first time he forgets to bring a shovel, and the second time he remembers his shovel, but the digging is too difficult.) He’ s ready to give up,
  but then Carlos calls him up with a new proposal: If Hyden gives him a map to the cocaine,
  Carlos will get it,
  sell it,
  and bring Hyden the money.Hyden agrees.A few weeks later,

Hyden was facing a mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison for attempted possession of cocaine, for which the jury finds him guilty, despite the fact that his lawyer argues entrapment. Thankfully, for Hyden, the judge on his case sentences him to only 60 days in jail, and five years of probation and five years of community service, at 20 hours a week.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',
