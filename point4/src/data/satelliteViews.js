	title: "Human Lips in Sudan",
	desc: "In the top view, you can see the area as luscious red lips of a human. In reality, it is a hill formation that can be found in Gharb, Darfur, Sudan. If you have a wild imagination, you may think that it may swallow its surrounding area and everything on it. It may contain a black hole and you don’t know where it will end. Thus, it can be a bit creepy if you think about it."

People thought that it was related to religious sects but it turned out to be simply an outline of a park.'
