Mount Kinabalu, along with other upland areas of the Crocker Range is well-known worldwide for its tremendous botanical and biological species biodiversity with plants of Himalayan, Australasian, and Indo-Malayan origin. A recent botanical survey of the mountain estimated a staggering 5,000 to 6,000 plant species (excluding mosses and liverworts but including ferns), which is more than all of Europe and North America (excluding tropical regions of Mexico) combined. It is therefore one of the world’s most important biological sites. Standing majestically at 4,095m (13,435 feet above sea level), Mount Kinabalu is the highest mountain between the Himalayas and New Guinea. Mount Kinabalu derives its name from the Kadazan word, ‘Aki Nabalu’, meaning ‘the revered place of the dead’.

As turtle landings usually occur after dusk, an overnight stay would be the best plan to see the turtles as they come ashore to lay their eggs, but shining a light on them or using camera flashes should be avoided as either can be stressful on the creatures.

The Sabah Museum, located in the shop houses at Gaya Street, Kota Kinabalu, was officially opened in July 15, 1965. The establishment of the Museum was to a large extent due to the efforts of the Sabah Society. In fact, the famous Woolley Collection, which formed the foundation collection of the incipient museum, belonged to Mr. G.C. Woolley, the executive officer designate of the proposed society (died in 1947). The first Curator of the Sabah Museum was Mr. E.J. Berwick. The Sabah Museum grew and expanded rapidly while still located at Gaya Street. It was reflective of the State Government's commitment to the Sabah Museum when a much larger (43 acres), permanent and prestigious site for the purpose-built museum was chosen where the old Government House (and later the State Legislative Assembly buildings) used to be. The official opening of the Sabah Museum, located at its present site was officiated by His Majesty the Yang Di-Pertuan Agong on April 11, 1984. In 1985, the post of Curator was upgraded to the Director of Sabah Museum. Presently, the Museum comes under the State Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Environment.","panoid":"nLviWGow3ZMAE_Uea9ymSg","lat":"5.960669","lng":"116.071683","pitch":"-7.57","heading":"-115.78","source":"http://www.museum.sabah.gov.my/"},"national-museum-of-malaysia":{"title":"National Museum of Malaysia","description":"The National Museum is a museum located on Jalan Damansara in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
