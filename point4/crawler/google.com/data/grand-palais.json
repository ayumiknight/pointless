Construction of the Grand Palais began in 1897 as part of the preparation works for the Universal Exposition of 1900, which also included the creation of the adjacent Petit Palais and Pont Alexandre III. The structure was built in the style of Beaux-Arts architecture as taught by the École des Beaux-Arts of Paris. The building reflects the movement's taste for ornate decoration through its stone facades, the formality of its floor planning and the use of techniques that were innovative at the time, such as its glass vault and its use of reinforced concrete.","panoid":"aT0BVFzINiEAAAQpmCI1FA","lat":"48.865766","lng":"2.312359","pitch":"-11.49","heading":"9.83","pano":"grand-palais"}}
