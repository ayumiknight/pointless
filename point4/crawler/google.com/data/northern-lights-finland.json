Auroras can take many different visual forms. The most distinctive and brightest are the curtain-like auroral arcs. They eventually fragment or ‘break-up’ into separate, and rapidly changing, often rayed features which may fill the whole sky. The northern lights have had a number of names throughout history. The Cree called the phenomenon the \"Dance of the Spirits\". In Medieval Europe, the auroras were commonly believed to be a sign from God.","panoid":"kJPO1zlKRtMAAAQZLDcQIQ","lat":"68.509047","lng":"27.481808","pitch":"-14.65","heading":"-37.8","pano":"northwest-aurora-borealis"}}
