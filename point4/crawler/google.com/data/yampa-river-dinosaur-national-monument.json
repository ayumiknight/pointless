Scouting this rapid (stopping above it to study it and determine the best way through) is the norm.","panoid":"lf99IU1hPIw5llhsyvVOww","lat":"40.529395","lng":"-108.928578","pitch":"-16.19","heading":"-57.06","source":"http://www.nps.gov/dino/planyourvisit/2012warmspringsrapidrockfall.htm"},"confluence-with-green-river":{"title":"Confluence with Green River","description":"Here at Echo Park, the Yampa River has traveled nearly 250 miles from its mountain source to this confluence with the Green River.","panoid":"VtBRnQyeneMlkxxK17x-Cw","lat":"40.528165","lng":"-108.985374","pitch":"-8.65","heading":"16.43","source":"http://www.nps.gov/dino/naturescience/rivers.htm"},"tiger-wall":{"title":"Tiger Wall","description":"\"Tiger Wall\" is a popular spot on most Yampa River rafting trips.
