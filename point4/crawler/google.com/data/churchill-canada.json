Buggy One is a high-tech Tundra Buggy with Internet connectivity and broadcasting ability. During the fall months, it travels the tundra with scientists and polar bear experts on board. Dr. Ian Stirling, a renowned polar bear scientist, helped build this tower decades ago, using it as a base to research polar bear behavior. Through cameras mounted on the top of the tower, scientists, university students, and members of the public can view can view the polar bears in this area. The cage provides protection from the bears if scientists must stand directly on the tundra.","panoid":"YqZ3OWlHI8rPgKxmOKvVWg","lat":"58.758444","lng":"-93.231829","pitch":"-2.01","heading":"15.79"},"polar-bear-roaming-the-shores-of-hudson-bay":{"title":"Polar bear roaming the shores of Hudson Bay","description":"Near Churchill, Manitoba, along the shores of Hudson Bay, polar bears roam and explore the coastal area, waiting for sea ice to form. Due to climate change, the sea ice is forming later in the fall and melting earlier in the summer, decreasing the time that polar bears have to hunt. At that point in time, the bears have not eaten since the ice on the Hudson Bay melted—about 4 months earlier. While some bears may appear thin this time of year, this bear looks relatively healthy.","panoid":"gSOnzC3e7AQTZIEwsP_ElA","lat":"58.791384","lng":"-93.7377","pitch":"26.13","heading":"85.76","source":"http://www.polarbearsinternational.org/about-polar-bears"},"sparring-polar-bears":{"title":"Sparring polar bears","description":"Two male polar bears pass the time by sparring.
