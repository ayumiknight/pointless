The 3-km canal waterway, built in Ming Dynasty and Qing Dynasty, is praised by tourism experts as the “living ancient canal”. It is a city with famous historical and cultural heritages including 72 temples and other architectures in eight major styles. It has the cultural characteristics exclusive to regions along the canal featured by the blending of North China and South China elements, and the Chinese and overseas contents. Because of this, Taierzhuang is known as the “living fossil of canal culture” and “museum of Chinese residential buildings”. Last but not least, Taierzhuang is also ancient watertown with the densest waterway network and best-preserved relics. In Taierzhuang, there are many water streets and lanes stretching 15 km, making it possible for people to take a boat and tour the whole city.","panoid":"rY5ZW6S3sFUAAAAGOzOdpg","lat":"34.557692","lng":"117.74251","pitch":"2.69","heading":"-72.58","pano":"dayamen-street"}}
