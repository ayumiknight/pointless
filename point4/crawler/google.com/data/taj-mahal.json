{"taj-mahal-view-of-the-garden":{"title":"Taj Mahal - View of the Garden","description":"The complex is set around a large 300-metre (980 ft) square charbagh or Mughal garden. The garden uses raised pathways that divide each of the four quarters of the garden into 16 sunken parterres or flowerbeds. A raised marble water tank at the center of the garden, halfway between the tomb and gateway with a reflecting pool on a north-south axis, reflects the image of the mausoleum. The raised marble water tank is called al Hawd al-Kawthar, in reference to the \"Tank of Abundance\" promised to Muhammad.","panoid":"4WnUj5d9NaCn0WjD4t67jA","lat":"27.171954","lng":"78.042102","pitch":"-4.7","heading":"5.72","source":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal"},"taj-museum":{"title":"Taj Museum","description":"The West Wall is interspersed with domed chattris, and small buildings.

They were designed as working minaretsâ€”a traditional element of mosques, used by the muezzin to call the Islamic faithful to prayer. Each minaret is effectively divided into three equal parts by two working balconies that ring the tower. At the top of the tower is a final balcony surmounted by a chattri that mirrors the design of those on the tomb. The chattris all share the same decorative elements of a lotus design topped by a gilded finial. The minarets were constructed slightly outside of the plinth so that, in the event of collapse, (a typical occurrence with many tall constructions of the period) the material from the towers would tend to fall away from the tomb.","panoid":"jLlV0WoL6KfDqG5DQnvNUA","lat":"27.171693","lng":"78.041528","pitch":"1.38","heading":"52.59","source":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal"},"parent":{"title":"Taj Mahal","description":"The Taj Mahal comes from Persian and Arabic and means the \"Crown of Palaces\".
