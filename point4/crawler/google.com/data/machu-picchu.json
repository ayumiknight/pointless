In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.

It was probably the most amazing urban creation of the Inca Empire at its height; its giant walls, terraces and ramps seem as if they have been cut naturally in the continuous rock escarpments. The natural setting, on the eastern slopes of the Andes, encompasses the upper Amazon basin with its rich diversity of flora and fauna.","panoid":"mD4ThA4SthLifTAdt0lb4A","lat":"-13.165071","lng":"-72.544715","pitch":"9.21","heading":"-14.74","source":"http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/274"},"house-of-nobles":{"title":"House of Nobles","panoid":"7Teak5G7DlGXB9DTZSjEEQ","lat":"-13.164029","lng":"-72.544975","pitch":"14.31","heading":"24.53"},"astronomical-observatory-intiwatana":{"title":"Astronomical Observatory (Intiwatana)","description":"The Inti Watana stone is one of many ritual stones in South America.
